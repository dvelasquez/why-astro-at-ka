# .cursorrules for Sli.dev (Slidev) Presentation Project

This repository uses [Sli.dev (Slidev)](https://sli.dev/guide/) to create presentation slides.

## General Guidelines

- **Primary Format:** Slides are written in Markdown (`.md`) with YAML frontmatter. Each slide is separated by `---`.
- **Styling:** Use [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) utility classes for styling. Prefer valid UnoCSS classes in all suggestions and completions.
- **Themes:** The default `serif` theme is used. Theme-specific classes and features may be referenced.
- **Components:** Vue components and HTML/JSX snippets may be embedded in Markdown. Future code may include custom Vue components.
- **Configuration:** Project configuration is managed via `slidev.config.ts` and frontmatter in `slides.md`.

## Slide Content Guidelines

- **Frontmatter:** Use YAML frontmatter at the top of the file and for individual slides as needed.
- **Slide Separation:** Use `---` to separate slides.
- **Markdown:** Write content in standard Markdown. Use headings, lists, code blocks, images, and links as needed.
- **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers for syntax highlighting.
- **Layouts:** Use Slidev built-in layouts via frontmatter or `layout:` blocks.
- **Directives:** Use Slidev directives (e.g., `@click`, `@default`) as needed for interactivity.
- **KaTeX/Mermaid:** Use KaTeX for math and Mermaid for diagrams as supported by Slidev.

## Styling and Classes

- **UnoCSS:** Use UnoCSS utility classes for all styling. Avoid non-standard or non-UnoCSS classes.
- **Theme Classes:** Use theme-provided classes if needed for consistency with the serif theme.

## Vue/JSX/HTML

- **Embedded Components:** You may embed Vue/HTML/JSX directly in Markdown slides.
- **Custom Components:** Future slides may use custom Vue components. Place them in a `components/` directory and import as needed.

## Editor and Tooling

- **VSCode Extension:** Use the Slidev VSCode extension for enhanced editing and preview.
- **Cursor Suggestions:** If code suggestions are not working in `.md` files, ensure the file is recognized as Markdown and that the extension is active. Try reloading the window or restarting Cursor if issues persist.
- **Completions:** Prefer completions that are valid in the context of Slidev Markdown, UnoCSS, and Vue.

## Best Practices

- **Keep slides concise and focused.**
- **Use headings and lists for clarity.**
- **Leverage Slidev features (layouts, transitions, directives) for better presentations.**
- **Keep code DRY and modular, especially when using custom components.**
- **Document any custom components or advanced features in a `README.md` or comments.**
