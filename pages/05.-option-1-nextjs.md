# Option 1: Next.js

**The Familiar Choice**

* **Pros:**
    * Team familiarity (from previous unification project).
    * Massive community, great React/Preact support.
    * Flexible CSS solutions; GDPR banner integrated fine.
* **Cons (Our "Taming the CI Beast" Learnings):**
    * Painful upgrades (React 17&rarr;18, Next 13&rarr;14&rarr;15).
    * Self-hosting felt like an **afterthought**; Vercel-centric model was costly & led to custom, brittle solutions.
    * Performance battles: SSR &rarr; Hydration &rarr; Reconciliation issues, especially with 3rd party scripts messing with the DOM.
    * RSCs: Seemed complex *at the time*, not a direct fix for our "send less JS" goal.
    * Felt like a generalist framework, not optimized for our content-heavy, SEO-critical, mostly static needs.
