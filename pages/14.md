# Results: Performance & Widget Reuse

<ul>
  <li v-click="1"><strong>Performance (Lighthouse - Homepage):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Old Java App: <code>~64/100</code></li>
      <li>New Astro App (pre-optimization): <code>~69/100</code></li>
      <li>Key: Less JS by default, clear path for further optimization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click="2"><strong>Widget Reuse (Existing Preact Microfrontends):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Generally straightforward: widgets need an HTML element to mount.</li>
      <li>Challenge: Multiple widgets potentially loading their own Preact versions (future optimization area).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
- So, what about user-facing performance?
- We saw a modest but immediate improvement in our Lighthouse scores, going from about 64 to 69 on the homepage. This is before we even started doing any specific performance optimization work in Astro.
- The key win here isn't just the score, but the fact that we have a much better foundation. By shipping less JavaScript by default, we have a clear path to further improve our Core Web Vitals.
- Reusing our existing Preact widgets was also mostly straightforward, which was a big win for migration speed.
