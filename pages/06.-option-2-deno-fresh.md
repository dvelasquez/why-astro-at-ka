# Option 2: Deno / Fresh

<div class="prose">

**The Clean Slate**

* **Pros:**
    * Intriguing paradigm: Preact everywhere, SSR by default (good fit for our mostly static content).
    * Demo successful, GDPR banner integrated, good DX.
    * TailwindCSS support (a must for our new design system).
* **Cons:**
    * Significantly smaller community than Node.js.
    * Fresh was very new; perceived maturity risk.
    * Deno adoption would require extensive internal approval.
