<h1>Option 2: Deno / Fresh</h1>

<p><strong>The Clean Slate</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li v-click><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Intriguing paradigm: Preact &amp; JSX everywhere, <br>SSR by default (good fit for our mostly static content).</li>
      <li>Demo successful, GDPR banner integrated, good DX.</li>
      <li>TailwindCSS support (a must for our new design system).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Significantly smaller community than Node.js.</li>
      <li>Fresh was very new; perceived maturity risk.</li>
      <li>Deno adoption would require extensive internal approval.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
- Option two was Deno with the Fresh framework. This was the "clean slate" or innovative choice.
- The founder of Deno is Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js, so it has a strong heritage.
- We loved the philosophy: Preact everywhere, SSR by default. It worked well in our demo.
- However, the community is much smaller, and Fresh was very new. For an enterprise of our size, this felt like a maturity risk we weren't willing to take, especially given the internal approvals needed for a brand new runtime.
