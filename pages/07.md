<h1>Option 2: Deno / Fresh</h1>

<p><strong>The Clean Slate</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li v-click><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Intriguing paradigm: Preact &amp; JSX everywhere, <br>SSR by default (good fit for our mostly static content).</li>
      <li>Demo successful, GDPR banner integrated, good DX.</li>
      <li>TailwindCSS support (a must for our new design system).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Significantly smaller community than Node.js.</li>
      <li>Fresh was very new; perceived maturity risk.</li>
      <li>Deno adoption would require extensive internal approval.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Deno Deploy could be downsizing, from 35 to 12 to 7. 

Could be this an indicator of their health as a JS Runtime?
