# Implementation: Multi-App & Shared Components üèóÔ∏è

* **Key Decision: NO single giant Astro app!**
    * Separate Astro apps per business domain (Homepage, Search, Item Details etc.).
    * **Benefit:** Team autonomy, independent releases.
    * **Challenge:** More responsibility for Platform team (tooling, consistency).
* **Shared Libraries:**
    * Header, footer, etc., as versioned packages in a Monorepo:
        * Lerna-Lite, Turborepo, npm workspaces.
    * RenovateBot for automated dependency updates.
* **Tech Choices:**
    * **SSR** with Node.js adapter (SSG impractical for 50M+ ads).
    * **Preact** as primary UI framework (team experience, smaller bundles).
    * **TailwindCSS** adopted fully (new design system, styled-jsx issues).
