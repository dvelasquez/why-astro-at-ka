# Why Astro? The Island Architecture Advantage üèùÔ∏è

**Shipping HTML First, JavaScript Second (Only When Needed!)**

* **The Next.js Hydration Problem (for us):**
    1.  Server renders full React page.
    2.  Client renders HTML.
    3.  *3rd party scripts run, modify HTML.*
    4.  Full React JS bundle downloads & runs.
    5.  React compares its VDOM to (now modified) browser DOM &rarr; **Reconciliation pain, repaints.**
    6.  More 3rd party scripts run...
    * Result: Multiple re-renders, potential race conditions, poor Core Web Vitals.
* **Astro's Approach:**
    1.  Server renders HTML.
    2.  Client renders HTML (mostly static).
    3.  *Only* JS for explicit `<client:*> ` components is sent and hydrated.
    * Result: **Less JS, faster loads, smaller interactive islands, fewer conflicts.**
