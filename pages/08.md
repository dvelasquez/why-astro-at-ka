<h1>Option 3: Astro</h1>

<p><strong>The Challenger</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li v-click><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Island Architecture:</strong> Send HTML by default, hydrate only <br>specific components (`client:load`, etc.). Directly addressed <br>Next.js hydration/3rd party script issues. <strong>Less JS = Faster Loads!</strong></li>
      <li><strong>UI Framework Agnostic:</strong> React, Preact, Vue, Solid, Svelte - flexibility for the future.</li>
      <li>Mature &amp; <strong>Self-Hosting First:</strong> Vibrant community, stable, first-class Node.js self-hosting support.</li>
      <li>Demo successful, GDPR banner integrated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click><strong>Cons/Considerations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Steeper learning curve: <code>.astro</code> syntax, frontmatter.</li>
      <li>New Tooling: Vite &amp; Vitest (team mostly knew Webpack &amp; Jest).</li>
      <li><code>styled-jsx</code> SSR limitation: Existing widgets would render client-side until migrated to TailwindCSS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
- This brought us to our third option, Astro, which was proposed by another staff engineer.
- Astro's big selling point for us was its "Island Architecture." It shared the "less JS" philosophy of Fresh but in a way that seemed more explicit and purpose-built for our problems.
- It was framework-agnostic, mature, and had first-class support for self-hosting, which was a critical requirement.
- The cons were real—a new syntax to learn and new tooling for our platform team to support—but the pros seemed to directly target our biggest pain points.
