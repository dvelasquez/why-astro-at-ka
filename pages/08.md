# Why Astro? The Island Architecture Advantage 🏝️

**The Core Idea: HTML First, JavaScript Only Where Needed!**

* **What is Island Architecture?** (Astro's Approach)
    * 🏝️ **HTML First** Everything is HTML by default.
    * 💧 **Selective Hydration** Only hydrate interactive components.
    * 🚀 **Zero JS by Default** JavaScript is only sent when needed.
    * ⚙️ **Granular Control** You decide *how* and *when* each island becomes interactive.
