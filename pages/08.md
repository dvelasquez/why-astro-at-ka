# Option 3: Astro

**The Challenger**

* **Pros:**
    * 🏝️ **Island Architecture:** Send HTML by default, hydrate only <br>specific components (`<client:load>`, etc.). Directly addressed <br>Next.js hydration/3rd party script issues. **Less JS = Faster Loads!**
    * 🧩 **UI Framework Agnostic:** React, Preact, Vue, Solid, Svelte - flexibility for the future.
    * Mature & **Self-Hosting First:** Vibrant community, stable, first-class Node.js self-hosting support.
    * Demo successful, GDPR banner integrated.
* **Cons/Considerations:**
    * Steeper learning curve: `.astro` syntax, frontmatter.
    * New Tooling: Vite & Vitest (team mostly knew Webpack & Jest).
    * `styled-jsx` SSR limitation: Existing widgets would render client-side until migrated to TailwindCSS.
