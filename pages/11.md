<!--
- Making the decision was a very deliberate process. We didn't just pick a framework in isolation.
- The platform team created an Architectural Decision Record, or ADR, and opened it as a Request for Comments for four weeks. This gave every web engineer in the company a chance to weigh in.
- Once we chose Astro, we focused on buy-in. We ran workshops and then partnered with the Homepage team for a real-world Proof of Concept. We de-risked the launch by rolling it out gradually to our users, from 1% all the way to 100%.
