# Why Astro? The Island Architecture Advantage 🏝️

**The Core Idea: HTML First, JavaScript Only Where Needed!**

* **What is Island Architecture?** (Astro's Approach)
    * 🏝️ **HTML First** Everything is HTML by default.
    * 💧 **Selective Hydration** Only hydrate interactive components.
    * 🚀 **Zero JS by Default** JavaScript is only sent when needed.
    * ⚙️ **Granular Control** You decide *how* and *when* each island becomes interactive.

<!--
- This is a crucial slide. Why did we choose Astro? The Island Architecture.
- The core idea is simple but powerful: everything is static HTML first. JavaScript is an opt-in, not a default.
- You build your UI with components, but by default, they just render to HTML and ship no client-side JavaScript.
- You then explicitly mark the interactive components—the "islands"—that need to be hydrated on the client. You even get to control *how* and *when* they load, for example, when they become visible in the viewport.
- This was a fundamental shift from the "hydrate everything" model of Next.js.
