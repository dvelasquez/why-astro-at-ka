# Challenges & Learning Curves ðŸŽ¢

* **Learning Astro:** `.astro` syntax, `defineAction()`, distinguishing component types â€“ initial confusion for some. Internal expertise was key.
* **Testing:** `styled-jsx` + Preact + Vitest + `@testing-library/preact` was problematic, accelerating Tailwind adoption.
* **Long-Term Maintenance:** Minor concerns about Astro concept longevity/breaking changes (Platform team to manage upgrades).
* **Server Features:** Monitoring/logging less mature out-of-the-box, requiring custom setup.
* **Multi-App Coordination:** Ongoing effort for platform team.
