*In the legacy setup, a single Java application handled all frontend and backend logic. To avoid changing the monolith, teams developed microfrontends (like the GDPR Banner, Promotion Banner, and MessageBox) as React/Preact UMD bundles. These widgets are mounted into the main features at runtime and can be released independently from the main Java app.*
