# The Rendering Dilemma

**The Problem:**

* **SSR → Hydration → Reconciliation**: Next.js hydrates the entire React tree on the client after SSR.
* **Kleinanzeigen's Challenge:**
  - Pages with thousands of DOM nodes (e.g., search results).
  - Multiple third-party scripts (analytics, ads, marketing) modify the DOM before/during hydration.
  - Result: Frequent layout shifts, hydration mismatches, and poor Core Web Vitals.

<BrowserContainer>
  <BrowserElement label="Header" :heightFraction="1" color="bg-blue-400" />
  <BrowserElement label="Advertisement" :heightFraction="1" color="bg-green-400" />
  <BrowserElement label="Content" :heightFraction="2" color="bg-red-400" />
</BrowserContainer>

<!--
- To visualize the problem, consider a typical Kleinanzeigen page. The server sends HTML, but before our app's JavaScript can even run, third-party ad and analytics scripts often load and modify the page.
- In the Next.js model, React would then load and try to "hydrate" the page, comparing its virtual DOM to what was *actually* in the browser. It would find differences caused by the third-party scripts, leading to a complex reconciliation process, content flashing, and layout shifts that hurt our Core Web Vitals.
- Astro avoids this by not hydrating the whole page. The static content is left alone, and only the small, isolated islands are hydrated, minimizing conflicts.
