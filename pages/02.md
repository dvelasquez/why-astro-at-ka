<!--
- So, what is Kleinanzeigen? For those of you here in Spain, think Wallapop or Milanuncios, but for Germany. It's a massive platform with a long history, starting as eBay Kleinanzeigen over 16 years ago.
- We're in a unique "adolescence" phase. We're not a startup anymore, but we're still growing incredibly fast, from a small team to almost 500 people today.
- This growth means change. Our new owners have a clear goal for us: Grow. This has driven a need to fundamentally evolve our platform.
- The carousel here shows a bit of that visual evolution over the years.
