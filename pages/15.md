# Challenges &amp; Learning Curves ðŸŽ¢
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li v-click><strong>Learning Astro:</strong> <code>.astro</code> syntax, <code>defineAction()</code>, distinguishing component types â€“ initial confusion for some. Internal expertise was key.</li>
  <li v-click><strong>Testing:</strong> <code>styled-jsx</code> + Preact + Vitest + <code>@testing-library/preact</code> was problematic, accelerating Tailwind adoption.</li>
  <li v-click><strong>Long-Term Maintenance:</strong> Minor concerns about Astro concept longevity/breaking changes (Platform team to manage upgrades).</li>
  <li v-click><strong>Server Features:</strong> Monitoring/logging less mature out-of-the-box, requiring custom setup.</li>
  <li v-click><strong>Multi-App Coordination:</strong> Ongoing effort for platform team.</li>
</ul>

<!--
- Of course, the journey wasn't perfect. There were challenges.
- Astro has a learning curve. The `.astro` syntax and concepts like `defineAction` were new to our team. Having internal experts to guide developers was crucial.
- Our existing tests for `styled-jsx` components were difficult to migrate to the new Vitest toolchain, which accelerated our move to TailwindCSS.
- We also had to address typical enterprise concerns, like building our own monitoring and logging solutions for the Node.js server and thinking about long-term maintenance.

# JSX vs Astro syntax

```tsx
export interface Props {
  text: string;
}
export function ReactComponent({ text }: Props) {
  return (<>
      <h1 className="tailwind-class">Simple React Component</h1>
      <p>{text}</p>
    </>)
}

```

## The same component as astro

```astro
---
interface Props {
  text: string;
}
const { text } = Astro.props;
---
<>
  <h1 class="tailwind-class">Simple Astro Component</h1>
  <p>{text}</p>
</>

```

<!--
- For those of you familiar with JSX, hereâ€™s a quick look at the Astro component syntax.
- Itâ€™s very similar, but with a key difference: the component script lives inside the "frontmatter" fence at the top, separated by three dashes.
- This clear separation between the server-side setup code and the client-side template is a core concept in Astro.
