*In the new architecture, each Astro app is paired with its own Java API backend, all connecting to shared microservices. This enables team autonomy and independent releases.*

<!--
- A key architectural decision was to avoid creating another monolith. Our experience taught us that large, single applications become bottlenecks.
- Instead, we are building a "Multi-App" architecture. Each major domain—Homepage, Search, Item Details—is its own independent Astro application. This allows the teams that own these domains to release features completely independently.
- The diagram shows this concept: separate Astro apps, each talking to their own dedicated Java API backend, which in turn communicates with our shared microservices. This empowers team autonomy.
