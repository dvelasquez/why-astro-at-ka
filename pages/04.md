<!--
- This diagram illustrates the situation perfectly. The big Java Monolith on the left handled everything, and releasing a change through it took at least an hour.
- To get around this, teams built these small, independent widgets, like the GDPR banner or promotional pop-ups, which could be released in just a few minutes.
- While this gave us some agility, it created a fragmented ecosystem of over 50 widgets and didn't solve the core problem: we couldn't efficiently improve our main user-facing features like search or the homepage.

# A Microfrontend Example

This example is a GDPR banner that is loaded on all pages.

<br>
<br>

```html{1-2|3|4-14|5|8-13|all}
<script type="module" 
  src="https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/gdpr/gdpr-consent-management-platform/es/tcfApiStub.min.js"></script> 
<div id="consentBanner" data-initialprops="{...}" class="gdpr-cmp"></div> 
<script type="module">
const consentBannerUrl = "https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/gdpr/gdpr-consent-management-platform/es/tcfApiBanner.min.js";

import(consentBannerUrl)
  .then((module) => {
    window.ekGdprConsentBanner = module;
    // fire an event when consent is ready
    const event = new CustomEvent("gdpr.consent-ready");
    document.dispatchEvent(event);    
  });
</script>
```

<!--
- Hereâ€™s a real-world example of one of those widgets. This is how our GDPR banner was loaded.
- Don't worry too much about the code details. The key takeaway is that we were injecting these isolated JavaScript modules into the monolith's HTML at runtime.
- It worked, but it was a symptom of a larger architectural problem. We were patching the ship instead of rebuilding it.
