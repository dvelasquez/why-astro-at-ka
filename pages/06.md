<h1>Option 1: Next.js</h1>

<p><strong>The Familiar Choice</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li v-click><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Team familiarity (from previous unification project).</li>
      <li>Massive community, great React/Preact support.</li>
      <li>Flexible CSS solutions; GDPR banner integrated fine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Painful upgrades (React 17&rarr;18, Next 13&rarr;14&rarr;15).</li>
      <li>Self-hosting felt like an <strong>afterthought</strong>; Vercel-centric model was costly &amp; led to custom, brittle solutions.</li>
      <li>Performance battles: SSR &rarr; Hydration &rarr; Reconciliation issues, especially with 3rd party scripts messing with the DOM.</li>
      <li>RSCs: Seemed complex <em>at the time</em>, not a direct fix for our "send less JS" goal.</li>
      <li>Felt like a generalist framework, not optimized for our content-heavy, SEO-critical, mostly static needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
