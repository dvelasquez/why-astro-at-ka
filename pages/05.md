<h1>The Search for a Modern Solution</h1>

<ul>
  <li v-click><strong>Goals:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Evolve the <em>entire</em> platform, especially core pages, with modern tools.</li>
      <li>Improve Time to Market.</li>
      <li>Keep SEO (or even better, improve it).</li>
      <li>Prioritise HTML over JS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click><strong>Key Requirements:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Leverage existing team skills: <strong>React/Preact &amp; TypeScript</strong>.</li>
      <li>Improve Developer Experience (DX) &amp; Performance.</li>
      <li>Excellent <strong>self-hosting</strong> support (critical for our scale).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li v-click><strong>Evaluation Process:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple Demo App: Homepage, Search Results, Item Details.</li>
      <li>Integrated a complex existing Preact widget (GDPR banner) to test compatibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
- So, in 2023, we began the search for a modern solution.
- Our goals were clear: We needed to improve our time-to-market, maintain or improve our strong SEO, and shift our philosophy to prioritize sending HTML over JavaScript wherever possible.
- Critically, we had to work with our existing team's skills in React/Preact and TypeScript, and any solution needed excellent self-hosting support because our scale makes PaaS platforms like Vercel prohibitively expensive.
- Our evaluation was pragmatic: we built a small demo app with core pages and integrated one of our existing complex widgets to see how each framework handled a real-world scenario.

# But,  what if...

We merge some marketplaces into one platform?

Entering "the unification project".

Staring:

<div class="flex flex-wrap w-full">
  <div v-click class="w-1/3 p-2 flex justify-center">
    <img src="/logo-leboncoin.svg" class="w-full max-w-xs" />
  </div>
  <div v-click class="w-1/3 p-2 flex justify-center">
    <img src="/logo-milanuncios.svg" class="w-full max-w-xs" />
  </div>
  <div v-click class="w-1/3 p-2 flex justify-center">
    <img src="/logo-kleinanzeigen-horizontal.svg" class="w-full max-w-xs" />
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div v-click>
Sounds easy right? Let's spicy it up:
</div>
<br>
<div class="flex flex-wrap w-full">
  <div v-click class="w-1/3 p-2 flex justify-center">
    <img src="/logo-subito.svg" class="w-full max-w-xs" />
  </div>
  <div v-click class="w-1/3 p-2 flex justify-center">
    <img src="/logo-marktplaats.svg" class="w-full max-w-xs" />
  </div>
  <div v-click class="w-1/3 p-2 flex justify-center">
    <img src="/logo-2dehands.svg" class="w-full max-w-xs" />
  </div>
</div>

<!--
- But then, a plot twist. An ambitious "unification project" began. The idea was to merge several of Adevinta's European marketplaces, like Leboncoin from France and Milanuncios from Spain, onto a single, unified platform.
- As you can see, this involved massive, well-known brands.
- And just to make it more interesting, we added even more marketplaces to the mix. The complexity grew exponentially.

# Should we start from scratch?

Nah, let's use the biggest codebase we have!

<div class="flex flex-wrap w-full">
  <img v-click src="/polaris.png" width="500px">
  <div class="pl-8">
    <h2 v-click>Some quick stats:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li v-click>~100 devs</li>
      <li v-click>~15.000 code files</li>
      <li v-click>~18.000 unit tests</li>
      <li v-click>~200 PRs created weekly</li>
      <li v-click>100% test coverage</li>
      <li v-click>CI time: 1 hour</li>
      <li v-click>18 months working on this</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!--
- The plan was not to start from scratch, but to use the largest, most feature-rich codebase we had: the Next.js platform from Leboncoin in France.
- This was a massive undertaking. We're talking about a codebase with 15,000 files, 18,000 unit tests, and a CI that took an hour to run.
- For 18 months, our team was deep in this world. This gave us an incredibly detailed, and sometimes painful, real-world education on the challenges of running a very large Next.js application at scale.

<!--
- So, what could go wrong with such a grand plan? An acquisition.
- Blackstone and Permira acquired Adevinta, and the business strategy shifted. The unification project was cancelled, and the new focus was to make each individual marketplace more profitable to prepare it for a potential sale.
- So, after 18 months, it was time to go back to our old Java platform and start our modernization journey over, but this time, we were armed with a lot of new knowledge.
