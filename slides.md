# The Search for a Modern Solution üöÄ

* **Goal:** Evolve the *entire* platform, especially core pages, with modern tools.
* **Key Requirements:**
    * Leverage existing team skills: **React/Preact & TypeScript**.
    * Improve Developer Experience (DX) & Performance.
    * Excellent **self-hosting** support (critical for our scale).
* **Evaluation Process:**
    * Simple Demo App: Homepage, Search Results, Item Details.
    * Integrated a complex existing Preact widget (GDPR banner) to test compatibility.

# Option 3: Astro

<div class="prose">

**The Challenger**

* **Pros:**
    * üèùÔ∏è **Island Architecture:** Send HTML by default, hydrate only specific components (`<client:load>`, etc.). Directly addressed Next.js hydration/3rd party script issues. **Less JS = Faster Loads!**
    * üß© **UI Framework Agnostic:** React, Preact, Vue, Solid, Svelte - flexibility for the future.
    * Mature & **Self-Hosting First:** Vibrant community, stable, first-class Node.js self-hosting support.
    * Demo successful, GDPR banner integrated.
* **Cons/Considerations:**
    * Steeper learning curve: `.astro` syntax, frontmatter.
    * New Tooling: Vite & Vitest (team mostly knew Webpack & Jest).
    * `styled-jsx` SSR limitation: Existing widgets would render client-side until migrated to TailwindCSS.

# Why Astro? The Island Architecture Advantage üèùÔ∏è

**Shipping HTML First, JavaScript Second (Only When Needed!)**

* **The Next.js Hydration Problem (for us):**
    1.  Server renders full React page.
    2.  Client renders HTML.
    3.  *3rd party scripts run, modify HTML.*
    4.  Full React JS bundle downloads & runs.
    5.  React compares its VDOM to (now modified) browser DOM &rarr; **Reconciliation pain, repaints.**
    6.  More 3rd party scripts run...
    * Result: Multiple re-renders, potential race conditions, poor Core Web Vitals.
* **Astro's Approach:**
    1.  Server renders HTML.
    2.  Client renders HTML (mostly static).
    3.  *Only* JS for explicit `<client:*> ` components is sent and hydrated.
    * Result: **Less JS, faster loads, smaller interactive islands, fewer conflicts.**

# The Decision & Rollout ‚úÖ

* **Process:**
    * Platform team: Demos & evaluations.
    * Architectural Decision Record (ADR) + RFC (4 weeks) for Community of Practice (CoP) feedback.
    * **Astro Chosen!**
* **Buy-in & Proof of Concept (PoC):**
    * Workshops to introduce Astro to engineers.
    * Partnered with Homepage team to rebuild it in Astro.
    * Gradual rollout: **1% &rarr; 10% &rarr; 40% &rarr; 100%** traffic.

# Implementation: Multi-App & Shared Components üèóÔ∏è

* **Key Decision: NO single giant Astro app!**
    * Separate Astro apps per business domain (Homepage, Search, Item Details etc.).
    * **Benefit:** Team autonomy, independent releases.
    * **Challenge:** More responsibility for Platform team (tooling, consistency).
* **Shared Libraries:**
    * Header, footer, etc., as versioned packages in a Monorepo:
        * Lerna-Lite, Turborepo, npm workspaces.
    * RenovateBot for automated dependency updates.
* **Tech Choices:**
    * **SSR** with Node.js adapter (SSG impractical for 50M+ ads).
    * **Preact** as primary UI framework (team experience, smaller bundles).
    * **TailwindCSS** adopted fully (new design system, styled-jsx issues).

# Results: Developer Experience Wins! üéâ

* **Onboarding:** `<15 minutes` for new Astro Homepage vs. `days` for Java monolith.
* **CI/CD Drastically Faster:**
    * Linting & Unit Tests: `~1.5 minutes`
    * E2E Tests: `~2 minutes`
    * Build & Deploy: `~5 minutes`
    * (vs. Java: 15 min non-prod deploy, >1 hour full prod release).
* **Developer Quotes:**
    * *"Very smooth and easy to use."*
    * *"Great! It is easy to install and run, documentation is also very good."*
    * *"very easy to learn coming from react with next.js experience"*
    * *"Nice and modern."*

# Conclusion: Astro - The Right Tool for *Our* Job

<img src="/2025-04-23/conclusion-astro-logo.png" class="h-40 mx-auto my-6" alt="Astro Logo with Text Conclusion"/>
**Why Astro over Next.js for Kleinanzeigen?**

* üèùÔ∏è **Island Architecture** was a perfect fit for our content-heavy, SEO-critical pages.
* ‚ö° Directly addressed performance bottlenecks (hydration, 3rd party scripts).
* üõ†Ô∏è Improved DX, faster CI/CD, framework flexibility, strong self-hosting.

Astro empowered us to tackle our Value Creation Plan with speed and confidence.
